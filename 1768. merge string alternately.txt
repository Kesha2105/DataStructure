You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        int n1 = word1.length();
        int n2 = word2.length();
        int i = 0;
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while(i < n1 && i < n2 ){
            result.append(word1.charAt(i));
            result.append(word2.charAt(i));
            i++;
        }
        if(i < n1){
            result.append(word1.substring(i));
        }
        if(i < n2){
            result.append(word2.substring(i));
        }
    return result.toString();
    }
}
